# exlaunch
A framework for injecting C/C++ code into Nintendo Switch applications/applet/sysmodules.

This is a fork of the original exlaunch by shadowninja108. This fork is intended to be used as a library for my projects.

# Note
You should look at the original exlaunch repository for more information. Do not use this fork unless you know what you are doing.
